# Green Light

*[Winner](https://devpost.com/software/traffic-zipper) of Electric City Hacks 2018*

In a future with the roads populated by driverless cars, existing intersections will be obsolete as traffic will be able to flow much more easily. However, not every city will be able to immediately redesign and reconstruct each of their intersections to make traffic more efficient. By each car communicating with the others in real time, Green Light will be able to optimize traffic flow in existing intersections by dynamically changing the speed of each car.
